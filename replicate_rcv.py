"""
Maine Congressional District 2 (2018) Ranked Choice Voting Replication by Nathan Tefft, Ph.D.

To run this replication script, include the Excel files containing the counted ballots in the same directory
    as the script, and set the working directory there.

This python script improves on and generalizes the notebook I created on 11/29/2018. Improvements include:
    1) The ability to run ranked-choice voting runoffs automatically for future votes 
    2) Although irrelevant to the final results, I changed the ballot labels to "exhausted" instead of
        "invalidated" after two consecutive skipped rankings, or when all remaining choices are reported as
        "undervote".
